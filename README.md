Drupal 7 sites folder and custom modules

The first custom module is called 'annotate'.
It is in the sites/all/modules/custom folder.

INSTALLATION

If you want to try out the modules in the repo

- The whole site tree is included for convenience
- but you might prefer just to use the module(s)
- and copy them delete the rest of the repo.
- You would then place the module(s) in your own
- sites/all/modules folder.
- However, I am using Netbeans and you might want to delete the
- Netbeans folder inside the sites folder since it has no place
- in a drupal installation.
